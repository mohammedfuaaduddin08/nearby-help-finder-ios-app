# nearby-help-finder-ios-app

**Nearby Help Finder** is an iOS mobile app designed to build stronger local communities.  
It allows neighbors to easily ask for help, share resources, and offer favors — whether it’s borrowing a book, finding a tool, or offering a ride.  

Requests appear on a **map**, and users can browse a **Favors** feed to see what people around them need or can provide.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📍 **Map view** — see help requests pinned in your neighborhood
- 📚 **Favors section** — list, browse, and respond to requests/offers
- 🔔 **Notifications** when someone nearby responds
- 📝 **Request form** to ask for items, help, or resources
- 🤝 **Community-driven** — designed to encourage local support

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **iOS (Swift / SwiftUI)**  
- **MapKit / CoreLocation** for location-based features  
- **Firebase / Supabase (optional)** for backend and real-time updates  (not yet implemented)
